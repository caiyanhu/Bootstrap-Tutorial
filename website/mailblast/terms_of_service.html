			<div id="content">
				<div class="container">
					<p>These TERMS OF SERVICE (this "Agreement") is made between Mailblast and you, or, if you represent an entity or other organization, that entity or
						organization (in either case "You").</p>
					<p>Mailblast provides certain services relating to the development, transmission, analysis, and management of email messages (the "Services") through
						the web site located at mailblast.io and such other sites as may be designated by Mailblast (each, the "Site" or collectively, the "Sites").</p>
					<p>All access to and use of the Services available through the Site is subject to the terms of this Agreement. If You wish to access and use the
						publicly available portions of the Services and the Site, You may do so only in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. If You have placed or
						later place an order (whether through the Site, by email, phone or otherwise) with Mailblast (Your "Order") seeking to access and use certain of the
						Services requiring registration, Mailblast is willing to accept Your Order and provide You with access to and use of those Services only if You
						comply
						with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>
					<p>Without limiting the foregoing, the Services are not available to individuals under the age of 18 or who do not meet any of the other
						qualifications
						included in this agreement.</p>
					<p>PLEASE CAREFULLY READ THIS AGREEMENT. BY SUBMITTING AN ORDER OR BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SITE OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND AGREE
						TO
						BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
					<p>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR DO NOT MEET THE QUALIFICATIONS INCLUDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, MAILBLAST IS NOT WILLING TO PROVIDE YOU WITH
						ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICES AND YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SITE OR SERVICES. IF YOU ACCESS OR USE THE SITE OR SERVICES, YOU
						ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU MEET THE QUALIFICATIONS INCLUDED IN THIS AGREEMENT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
					<p>This Agreement is entered into as of the earlier of the date You first submit an Order relating to the Services or first access or use the Services
						or a Site (the "Effective Date"). This Agreement consists of the following terms and conditions and each Order submitted by You and accepted by
						Mailblast, each of which is incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement. Unless otherwise amended as provided herein, this Agreement will
						exclusively govern Your access to and use of the Services and the Sites and is the complete and exclusive understanding and agreement between the
						parties, and supersedes any oral or written proposal, agreement or other communication between the parties, regarding Your access to and use of the
						Services and the Sites. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended or modified only by a writing signed by both
						parties. All waivers under this Agreement must be in writing. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will
						not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.</p>
					<p>Mailblast reserves the right, at any time, to change or modify the Site, Services or this Agreement, by making such change or modification
						available
						on the Site or by providing other notice to You. Any such change or modification will be effective 30 days after posting on the Site or such other
						notice. As applicable, You will be deemed to have agreed to such change or modification through Your continued use of the Site or Services.</p>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Definitions.</b>
							<p>Terms used in this Agreement will have the definitions given in this Agreement.</p>
						</li>
						<li><b>Orders and Confirmation.</b>
							<p>All Orders placed by You will be governed by the terms of this Agreement and are bounded by the terms stated in the Amazon Simple Email
								Service.
								Mailblast will confirm Your Order either through the Site at the time you submit Your Order or by providing You with access to the Services
								(each,
								a "Confirmation"). If the terms of any Order conflict with the terms of any Confirmation of that Order, the terms of the Confirmation will
								govern
								and control with respect to the Services provided to You. This Agreement will govern and control the terms of each Order and Confirmation under
								this Agreement. By accessing or using any of the Services, You agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and each applicable Order and
								Confirmation with respect to those Services.</p>
						</li>
						<li><b>Term.</b>
							<p>This Agreement will be effective upon the Effective Date. If You have ordered a trial subscription to the Services or a subscription to any
								free
								Services, as indicated in an applicable Order or Confirmation (a "Trial/Free Subscription"), then the term of this Agreement will continue for
								the
								period of the Trial/Free Subscription indicated in the applicable Order or Confirmation and will thereafter expire unless You place an Order for
								a
								non-trial subscription to the Services prior to the completion thereof. If You have ordered a non-trial subscription to the Services, then the
								term of this Agreement will continue for the initial period stated in the applicable Order or Confirmation for the Services and will thereafter
								automatically renew for successive additional periods of equal duration. If no initial period is stated in the applicable Order or Confirmation
								for the Services, this Agreement will continue for an initial period of 1 month and will thereafter automatically renew for successive
								additional
								1-month periods. Unless terminated as set forth herein, the term of this Agreement will continue to renew until You notify Mailblast that You do
								not wish to renew the Agreement at least 10 days prior to the end of the then-current period. In all other cases, the term of this Agreement
								will
								continue until terminated as set forth herein.</p>
						</li>
						<li><b>Subscription.</b>
							<p>Subject to this Agreement, during the term of this Agreement Mailblast will provide You with a limited subscription to access and use the
								Services subject to Confirmations under this Agreement, solely for Your own use in connection with your own business purposes. Your rights to
								access and use the Services are personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable. You understand that Mailblast may from time to
								time, in its sole discretion, update, change, revise, suspend or discontinue the Services (or any portion thereof) with or without notice. Along
								with the subscription with Mailblast, You are required to be a registered user with Amazon SES and the cost of which is not included in the
								service fees with Mailblast.</p>
						</li>
						<li><b>Access to the Services.</b>
							<p>Upon Confirmation of Your Order by Mailblast, the rights granted to You under this Agreement entitle You to access the Services through
								accounts
								(each, an "Account"). You will be provided with a user identification and password applicable to each Account You have purchased (each such user
								identification and password, an "Account ID"). Each Account ID is personal in nature and may be used only by You or, if You are an organization,
								by designated employees within Your organization or contractors who are contractually required to comply with the terms of this Agreement (such
								individual, as applicable, the "User" of the Account). You are solely responsible for all use of the Services by each User and for compliance by
								each User with the applicable terms of this Agreement. You will ensure the security and confidentiality of each Account ID and will notify
								Mailblast immediately if any Account ID is lost, stolen or otherwise compromised. You acknowledge that You are fully responsible for all costs,
								fees, liabilities or damages incurred through use of each Account ID (whether lawful or unlawful) and that any Services ordered or transactions
								completed through any Account or under any Account ID will be deemed to have been lawfully completed by You. In no event will Mailblast be
								liable
								for the foregoing obligations or the failure by You to fulfill such obligations. You will be solely responsible, at Your own expense, for
								acquiring, installing and maintaining all hardware, software and other equipment as may be necessary for You and each User to connect to,
								access,
								and use the Services and the Sites.</p>
						</li>
						<li><b>Applicable Policies.</b>
							<p>In addition to the terms of this Agreement, Your access to and use of the Site and Services is subject to Mailblast's then-current policies
								relating to the Site and Services, including, without limitation, the Mailblast Privacy Policy available on the Site. You are responsible for
								compliance with these policies and all other Mailblast policies applicable to the access and use of the Services posted to the Site or provided
								through Services.</p>
						</li>
						<li><b>Software.</b>
							<p>Any software or code available on or for download through the Site or Services ("Software") is protected by IPR (as defined below). Unless
								otherwise expressly stated in a license or other agreement separate from this Agreement that You may have entered into (or may enter into) with
								Mailblast relating to any Software (each such license or other agreement, a "Software License Agreement"), Mailblast grants you a limited,
								non-exclusive right and license to download, install and execute the Software in accordance with the instructions provided on the Site and
								solely
								for your own business purposes in connection with Your access to and use of the Services. Except as expressly set forth in the foregoing
								sentence
								(or any applicable Software License Agreement), You are granted no licenses or rights, whether by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, in or to
								any Software or any IPR therein or related thereto, and You may not modify, reproduce, perform, display, create derivative works from,
								republish,
								post, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, distribute, or in any way exploit any portion of the Software without the prior written
								permission of Mailblast. Except as set forth in this Agreement, any Software License Agreement will control in the event of a conflict between
								the
								terms of this Agreement and that Software License Agreement.</p>
						</li>
						<li><b>Third-Party Services.</b>
							<p>The Services may include services developed, provided or maintained by third-party service providers ("Third Party Services"). In addition to
								the
								terms of this Agreement, Your access to and use of any Third Party Services is also subject to any other agreement separate from this Agreement
								that You may enter into (or may have entered into) relating to those Third Party Services (each, a "Third Party Service Agreement"). The terms
								of
								any Third Party Service Agreement will apply to the applicable Third Party Services provided under that Third Party Service Agreement in
								addition
								to the terms of this Agreement. Except as set forth in this Agreement, the terms of any Third Party Service Agreement will control in the event
								of
								a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and that Third Party Service Agreement. All other Third Party Services will be subject to the
								terms
								of this Agreement. Third Party Services may be subject to additional Fees as set forth on the Site. Notwithstanding the terms of any Third Party
								Services Agreement, Mailblast may change, modify or discontinue any Third Party Service at any time and without notice to You. Except as
								expressly
								set forth in this Agreement or any Third Party Service Agreement, You are granted no licenses or rights, whether by implication, estoppel, or
								otherwise, in or to any Third Party Services.</p>
						</li>
						<li><b>Restrictions.</b>
							<p>You acknowledge that the Services, Sites, Software, and the databases, software, hardware and other technology used by or on behalf of
								Mailblast
								to provide the Services and operate the Sites (the "Technology") and their structure, organization, and underlying data, information and source
								code constitute valuable trade secrets of Mailblast. You will not, and will not permit any third party to: (1) access or use the Services or the
								Sites, in whole or in part, except as expressly provided in this Agreement; (2) use the Site, Services or any Software to harvest or collect
								e-mail addresses or other contact information of third parties by any means for the purposes of sending unsolicited e-mails or other unsolicited
								communications; (3) use the Site, Services or any Software in any unlawful manner or in any other manner that could damage, disable, overburden
								or
								impair the Site or Services; (4) use automated scripts to collect information from or otherwise interact with the Site, Services or any
								Software;
								(5) use the Site, Services or any Software to intimidate or harass any other people or entities; alter, modify, reproduce, create derivative
								works
								of the Services, Technology, or any Software; (6) distribute, sell, resell, lend, loan, lease, license, sublicense or transfer any of Your
								rights
								to access or use the Services or any Software, including, without limitation, providing outsourcing, service bureau, hosting, application

								provider or on-line services to third parties, or otherwise make the Services or any Software, or access thereto, available to any third party;
								(7) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code or method of operation of or any trade secrets
								embodied in the Site, Services, Technology or any Software; (8) attempt to circumvent or overcome any technological protection measures intended
								to restrict access to any portion of the Sites, Services, Technology, or any Software; or (9) interfere in any manner with the operation or
								hosting of the Sites, Services, Technology or any Software, or attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Sites, Services, Technology or any
								Software. You will not allow any access to or use of the Services by anyone other than Your authorized Users, and any such use will be
								consistent
								with the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in this Agreement.</p>

							<p>You agree to pay Mailblast all fees set forth in each Order or Confirmation and any fees otherwise specified on the Site or through the
								Services
								("Fees"). All Fees will be billed as indicated in each Order or Confirmation. If the applicable Order or Confirmation does not specify any
								applicable billing terms, the initial payment of Fees specified under that Order or Confirmation for each period in Your subscription will be
								due
								and payable by You in advance on or before the Effective Date and again on or before the completion of each subsequent period under this
								Agreement. If You have specified credit card or direct withdrawal from a bank account as an applicable payment mechanism under this Agreement,

								imposed on the Services provided under this Agreement.</p>
						</li>
						<li><b>Termination and Suspension.</b>
							<p>This Agreement may be terminated by Mailblast, at any time, in Mailblast's sole discretion: (1) upon any breach by You of this Agreement that
								remains uncured ten (10) days after Mailblast delivers written notice to You of such breach; or (2) at any time during any Trial/Free
								Subscription, for any reason or no reason, upon notice to You. Without limiting Mailblast's right to terminate this Agreement, Mailblast may

								<li>
									<b>By Mailblast.</b>
									<span>Except in the case of any Services provided during a Trial/Free Subscription, Mailblast will, at its expense, defend You against any claims brought against You by a third party that Your use of the Services in accordance with this Agreement infringes any copyright, trade secret or trademark right.

This Section 15.1 constitutes Mailblast's sole and exclusive liability, and Your sole and exclusive remedy, for any infringement or misappropriation of any third party IPR by or through the Site, Services, Technology, Mailblast Content or any Software.</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>By You. </b>
									<span>You hereby indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Mailblast and its affiliates, employees, agents, contractors, assigns, licensees, and successors in interest ("Indemnified Parties") from any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, fees, expenses, and costs (including attorneys' fees, court costs, damage awards, and settlement amounts) that result from any claim or allegation against any Indemnified Party arising from Your accessing or using the Site, Services, Software, Your Content, Mailblast Content, any email or other communication generated or sent through the Services, or any breach of this Agreement.

								JURISDICTIONS
								WHERE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES IS NOT PERMITTED, MAILBLAST'S LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT

								For the avoidance of doubt, (1) the Services, Technology, and Mailblast Content are the Confidential Information of Mailblast, (2) all data
								regarding Your email recipients, including without limitation, identities and email addresses are Your Confidential Information, and (3) the
								data
								and information specified in Section 17 will not be Your Confidential Information. Each party agrees to protect the other party's Confidential

								reasonable care. Each party agrees that, except as expressly directed by the other party, it will not at any time during or after the term of
								this
								Agreement: (1) disclose any Confidential Information to any third party; (2) permit any third party to examine and/or make copies of any
								reports,

								the
								purposes of this Agreement. Each party may disclose Confidential Information to personnel having a need to receive the Confidential Information

						<li><b>Disputes.</b>
							<p>Except as otherwise provided below, the parties will attempt to resolve all disputes, controversies, or claims arising under, out of, or
								relating
								to this Agreement, including the formation, validity, binding effect, interpretation, performance, breach or termination, of this Agreement and
								the arbitrability of the issues submitted to arbitration hereunder and non-contractual claims relating to this Agreement (each, a "Dispute"), in
								accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 21. If any Dispute cannot be resolved through negotiations between the parties within 5
								days of notice from one party to the other of the Dispute, such Dispute will be finally settled through binding arbitration under the
								arbitration
								of the International Chamber of Commerce ("ICC") then in effect (the "Rules"). Either party may commence the arbitration by delivering a request
								for arbitration as specified in the Rules. The arbitration will be conducted before a sole neutral arbitrator selected by agreement of the
								parties. If the parties cannot agree on the appointment of a single arbitrator within 30 days (the "Initial Period") after either party to this
								Agreement delivers a request for arbitration, a neutral arbitrator will be selected as provided in the Rules. The arbitration will be conducted
								exclusively in the English language at a site specified by Mailblast in Denver, Colorado U.S.A. The award of the arbitrator will be the
								exclusive
								remedy of the parties for all claims, counterclaims, issues or accountings presented or plead to the arbitrator. The award of the arbitrators
								will
								require payment of the costs, fees and expenses incurred by the prevailing party in any such arbitration by the non-prevailing party. Judgment
								upon the award may be entered in any court or governmental body having jurisdiction thereof. Any additional costs, fees or expenses incurred in
								enforcing the award may be charged against the party that resists its enforcement.</p>
						</li>
						<li><b>Governing Law.</b>
							<p>The interpretation of the rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement, including, to the extent applicable, any negotiations,
								arbitrations or other proceedings hereunder, will be governed in all respects exclusively by the laws of the Republic State of Singapore. Each
								party agrees that it will only bring any action or proceeding arising from or relating to this Agreement in a federal court in Singapore, and
								You
								irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of any such court in any such action or proceeding or in any action or proceeding
								brought in such courts by Mailblast.</p>
						</li>
						<li><b>General.</b>
							<p>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, that provision will be removed to the extent necessary to comply with the law,
								replaced by a provision that most closely approximates the original intent and economic effect of the original to the extent consistent with the
								law, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force. The prevailing party in any lawsuit or proceeding arising from or related to this
								Agreement will be entitled to receive its costs, expert witness fees and reasonable attorneys' fees, including costs and fees on appeal. Neither
								this Agreement nor any rights or obligations of You hereunder may be assigned or transferred by You (in whole or in part and including by sale,
								merger or operation of law) without the prior written approval of Mailblast. Any assignment in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.
								Mailblast may assign this Agreement to any party that assumes Mailblast's obligations hereunder. The parties hereto are independent parties, not
								agents, employees or employers of the other or joint venturers, and neither acquires hereunder any right or ability to bind or enter into any
								obligation on behalf of the other. This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the parties with respect to
								the
								subject matter of this Agreement, and this Agreement supersedes any proposal or prior agreement, oral or written, and any other communications
								between the parties in relation to the subject matter of this Agreement. Mailblast may reference You as a user of the Services and use Your name
								and logo, as applicable, in listings of users of the Services appearing on the Mailblast web site and for other marketing and promotional
