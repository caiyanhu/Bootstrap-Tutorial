				<div class="policy">
					<p>Mailblast is committed to protecting the privacy of the users of the mailblast.io web site (the "Site") and the services offered through the Site,
						including by way of example the email and other communications sent through those services (the "Services"). This privacy policy (the "Policy")
						discloses Mailblast' information privacy practices for the Site and Services. This policy is intended to inform users of our Services and other
						visitors
						to the Site of the information collection and use practices of the Site and Services.</p>
					<h3>Collection and use of information.</h3>
					<p>Mailblast collects information directly from the users of our Site and Services. Mailblast also receives information regarding users from our
						customers
						and from other third parties. We will not sell, share, transfer, or use the information we collect from users or receive from our customers or other

					<h3>Collection and use of information by our customers and other third parties.</h3>
					<p>Certain of the web sites of Mailblast's customers, advertisers or affiliates and other third-parties may be accessible through the Site or through
						email or other communications sent through the Services. You may be asked to provide personally identifiable information (or other information) to
						these
						customers or other third parties through these web sites or through the communications sent to you through the Services, including by way of example
						when you click on a link on the Site to one of these other web sites or on a link in an email or other communication sent through the Services.
						These
						customers and third parties maintain their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. This Policy covers only information collected
						through
						the Site and Services and does not extend to our customers or any third parties.</p>
					<p>MAILBLAST IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE POLICIES OR PRACTICES OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR ANY THIRD PARTIES. YOU SHOULD REVIEW THE APPLICABLE PRIVACY POLICIES
						OF
						OUR CUSTOMERS AND ANY THIRD PARTIES BEFORE PROVIDING THEM WITH ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.</p>
					<h3>Collection and use of personally identifiable information by Mailblast.</h3>
					<p>We only collect and use personally identifiable information regarding users of the Site or Services as described in this Policy. In addition, we do
						not
						process or use personally identifiable information that we collect or that is received from our customers or from other third parties in a way that
						is
						incompatible with the purposes for which it was collected or received or subsequently authorized by you. Except as noted in this Policy, personally
						identifiable information collected by Mailblast on the Site or through the Services is NOT shared with third parties without your consent.</p>
					<p>We may automatically collect personally identifiable information from you when you access the Site or use or access the Services. We may also
						collect
						personally identifiable information from you through a number of voluntary sources on the Site or through the Services, including through emails or
						other communications sent through the Services. For example, these sources may include responses, registrations, surveys, reviews, comments,
						confirmations, emails, postings, messages, telephone calls, written correspondence or other electronic submissions and communications sent by you to
						the
						Site or through the Services. The personally identifiable information we may collect from you will include, by way of example:</p>
					<ul>

						<li>Other information you volunteer to the Site, through the Services or through other means of communication, such as responses, registrations,
							surveys, reviews, comments, confirmations, emails, postings, messages, telephone calls, written correspondence or other electronic submissions and
							communications sent by you to the Site or through the Services.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>YOU SHOULD NOT PROVIDE MAILBLAST WITH ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (OR SUBMIT OR POST ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO THE
						SITE OR
						IN RESPONSE TO ANY EMAIL OR OTHER COMMUNICATION) UNLESS YOU WOULD LIKE THAT INFORMATION TO BE USED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS POLICY.</p>
					<p>If you register for the Site or Services through a third-party, the personally identifiable information you have provided in connection with your
						registration may be imported into your account from the Services. The personally identifiable information we may collect from you will also include
						any
						information imported from any such third-party.</p>
					<p>The personally identifiable information that Mailblast collects from users of the Site or Services (both registered and unregistered) may be used
						for a
						variety of purposes, including by way of example:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Providing the Services;</li>
						<li>Customizing advertising or other content displayed on the Site or through the Services;</li>
						<li>Customizing the layout of the Site or Services;</li>
						<li>Notifying users of the Site or Services about updates to and activities on the Site or Services and about goods and services that we feel may be
							of
							interest to you;
						</li>
						<li>Improving the content of the Site or Services;</li>
						<li>Analyzing data and patterns regarding usage of the Site or Services;</li>
						<li>Contacting users of the Site or Services for marketing purposes; and</li>
						<li>Contacting users of the Site or Services for information verification purposes.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We may also share certain personally identifiable information we collect through the Site or Services with third party companies so that they may
						offer
						products and services to users of our Site or Services that we believe will be of interest to those users. We may also share certain personally
						identifiable information with third party advertisement serving companies to better target the advertising and other content displayed on the Site
						or
						Services and provide pertinent offers we think may be of interest to our users.</p>
					<h3>Collection and use of non-personally identifiable information by Mailblast.</h3>
					<p>Where possible, our server automatically recognizes and collects certain non-personally identifiable information regarding visitors to the Site and
						users of the Services, including by way of example, IP address, browser type, and other information regarding the system and connection of each
						visitor
						or user. We also collect information about how visitors access and use the Site and Services, including by way of example what pages of the Site are
						viewed and what portions of services are used. When providing the Services, we collect information regarding the performance of the Services, which
						includes metrics related to the deliverability of emails and other electronic communications. This information allows us to improve the content of
						the
						Site and Services, facilitate research and analysis of the Site and Services, and develop and refine our Services. Sometimes, we utilize the
						services of
						a third party to help us understand this information better, although the information that is disclosed to these entities remains at all times in
						anonymous and non-personally identifiable form. We may also provide this information to our customers in anonymous and non-personally identifiable
						form.</p>
					<h3>Children.</h3>
					<p>The Site and Services are not directed to children under 13 years of age. Mailblast does not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from
						children under 13 years of age.</p>
					<h3>Sensitive Information.</h3>
					<p>Mailblast does not knowingly solicit or collect, and you should not provide, any information regarding your medical or health condition, race or
						ethnic
						origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or other sensitive information.</p>
					<h3>Disclosure as required by law.</h3>
					<p>Though we make every reasonable effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personally identifiable information of certain users of
						the
						Site or Services when we have a reasonable and good-faith belief that the disclosure is necessary to enforce the Terms of Use for the Site, comply
						with
						a judicial proceeding, court order or other legal process, or to otherwise enforce or protect Mailblast's rights under applicable law, including,
						without limitation, Mailblast's intellectual property rights. In this situation we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of this disclosure
						to
						all affected users, to the extent reasonably possible under the circumstances.</p>
					<h3>Service announcements and customer service.</h3>
					<p>On occasion it is necessary to send out service related announcements. For instance, if the Site or any of the Services is temporarily suspended
						for
						maintenance we might send users an email. We also communicate with users to provide customer service in accordance with our Terms of Service.
						Generally,
						users may not opt-out of these communications without also deactivating their account and ceasing use of the Services. These communications are not
						promotional in nature.</p>
					<h3>Special offers and updates.</h3>
					<p>We may send new registrants of the Site or Services a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members may occasionally also
						receive information on products, services and special deals, and periodic newsletters. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the
						option
						to not receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out section.</p>
					<h3>Choice and opt-out.</h3>
					<p>We provide you with a choice whether to receive certain emails and other communications through the Site and Services.</p>
					<p>We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes. If you are a user of the
						Site
						or Services and you no longer wish to receive emails or other communications from us or have your email address or other contact information shared
						with
						third parties, you may opt-out of receiving email or other communications from us or having your email address or other contact information shared
						with
						third parties. Some communications (e.g. important account notifications and billing information) are considered transactional and are necessary for
						all
						Mailblast customers. Customers must cancel your Mailblast account to unsubscribe you from these communications.</p>
					<p>In addition, if you would prefer that we not share your personally identifiable information with third parties for the third parties' direct
						marketing
						purposes, you may opt-out of having your personally identifiable information shared with third parties for the third parties' direct marketing
						purposes.</p>
					<p>All opt-out requests can be made by emailing us at: <a href="mailto:contact@mailblast.io">contact@mailblast.io</a>. Please note that it may take up
						to
						10 days to remove your contact information from our marketing communications lists, so you may receive correspondence from us for a short time after
						you make your request.</p>
					<h3>Cookies and web beacons.</h3>
					<p>"Cookies" include commonly used pieces of information in the form of small files that are placed on an individual's computer hard drive to enable
						the
						individual to more easily communicate and interact with the Site and Services. We may use cookies on the site or in communications sent through the
						Services for various purposes, including by way of example:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Saving user preferences;</li>
						<li>Customizing content of the Site for individual users;</li>
						<li>Ensuring that users are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads;</li>
						<li>Recording session information;</li>
						<li>Saving certain information about users of the Site and others who visit the Site; and</li>
						<li>Facilitating and enhancing interaction with the Site.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Mailblast does not use cookies to retrieve information from a computer that is unrelated to Mailblast or the Site or Services.</p>
					<p>A cookie does not collect or keep your name or other personally identifying information; however, we may link the information obtained through
						cookies
						to other personally identifiable information to give us a better understanding of your preferences, so that we can provide a more meaningful
						experience
						to you on our Site and through our Services.</p>
					<p>"Web beacons" (also known as "single-pixel" or "clear" GIFs) include electronic images imbedded in the Site or in communications sent through the
						Services which are invisible to users. Web beacons collect information, such as identifiers, time and date of access, and descriptions of the pages
						or
						communications in which the web beacons are imbedded. The Site and communications sent through the Services may include web beacons. We may use the
						web
						beacons on the Site and in communications sent through the Services for various purposes, including by way of example to track users who have
						visited
						our Site, viewed advertisements on the Site or in communications sent through the Services, or otherwise accessed communications sent through the
						Services.</p>
					<p>We may use an outside advertisement serving company to display advertisements on the Site or in communications sent through the Services. The
						advertisement serving company may place and collect cookies or web beacons when it displays an advertisement on the Site or through the Services. We
						do
						not have access to information that would confirm the use of cookies or web beacons by the advertisement serving company. We may also use a third
						party
						provider to analyze data and patterns regarding usage of the Site and the communications sent through Services. This third party provider may use
						cookies or web beacons to collect such information.</p>
					<p>Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is
						stored. You may also be able to refuse certain web beacons by adjusting the settings on your browser or email software. Please refer to your browser
						or
						email software instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.</p>
					<h3>Access, review and update of information.</h3>
					<p>Mailblast takes reasonable steps to ensure that the data we collect is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete and current. The users of
						the
						Site or Services should email us at <a href="mailto:contact@mailblast.io">contact@mailblast.io</a> to review, delete, deactivate, update or change
						any
						personal information that was previously provided to or collected by Mailblast.</p>
					<h3>Consent to the use of third party providers.</h3>
					<p>In addition to the specific third parties noted in this Policy, Mailblast may also contract with Agents to provide various services to Mailblast
						relating to the Site or Services on an outsourced basis rather than performing the services itself (as used here, "Agents" are persons on companies
						who
						act on behalf of or under the direction of Mailblast). For example, Mailblast may contract with a web site hosting provider to host all or a portion
						of
						the Site or Services for Mailblast.</p>
					<h3>Notification of changes.</h3>
					<p>Mailblast reserves the right to modify the AGREEMENTS at any time. Any modifications shall be effective upon the posting of the modified AGREEMENTS
						on
						Mailblast's Web site, whose URL is mailblast.io/privacy. YOU agree to review these AGREEMENTS periodically so that YOU are aware of any
						modifications.
						YOUR continued use of the SERVICE shall be deemed YOUr acceptance of the modified AGREEMENT.</p>
					<h3>Security.</h3>
					<p>We will use at least industry standard security measures on the Site to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our
						control.
						While there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet, we will take all reasonable steps to insure the safety of your personal
						information.
						For example, our policy is that only those individuals who need your personally identifiable information to perform a specific job are granted
						access to
						that personally identifiable information. Likewise, all employees and contractors are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.
						Finally,
						the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.</p>
					<h3>Verification.</h3>
					<p>Mailblast utilizes a self-assessment approach to ensure its compliance with this Policy. We regularly verify that this Policy is accurate,
						comprehensive, prominently displayed, completely implemented and in conformity with the Safe Harbor Principles and conduct our self-assessment on an
						annual basis. We appropriately train our employees and have internal procedures for conducting objective compliance reviews.</p>
					<h3>Contact Information.</h3>
					<p>All inquiries concerning this Policy and the Site or Services in general may be sent to <a
							href="mailto:contact@mailblast.io.">contact@mailblast.io.</a></p>
					<h3>Transfer of information.</h3>
					<p>If Mailblast elects, in its reasonable discretion, to transfer ownership or control of the Site or Services to a third party, whether or not in the
						context of an acquisition, merger, or reorganization, you consent to the transfer of your personally identifiable information and non-personally
						identifiable information by Mailblast to that third party, provided that all use of your information by that third party remains subject to the
						terms of
						this Policy.</p>
